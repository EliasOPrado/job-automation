# Job AutomationÂ ðŸ¤–

Some functionalities that need to be added

* [x] Linkedin login
* [x] Linkedin session storage
* [x] Linkedin job iteration
* [x] Linkedin job insertion

What need to be fixed:

1. Get the right url, since it is getting Linkedin url instead of getting the platform url
2. Improve error activities (appearing windows during the hob sync for example)
3. Add the hability to restart the integration if it breaks
4. Add proxy rotation

## Platform 

Things that need improvement:

[ ] Fix job list section to not refresh the page when clicking on the left card.
[ ] Fix platform responsiveness to be well fit for the majority screens.
