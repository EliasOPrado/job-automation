# Job AutomationÂ ðŸ¤–

Some functionalities that need to be added

* [x] Linkedin login
* [x] Linkedin session storage
* [x] Linkedin job iteration
* [x] Linkedin job insertion

What need to be fixed:

1. Get the right url, since it is getting Linkedin url instead of getting the platform url
2. Improve error activities (appearing windows during the hob sync for example)
3. Add the hability to restart the integration if it breaks
4. Add proxy rotation
